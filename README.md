# TechFusion_KirtiGarg
### The Problem Statement Title: Create a AI-driven and IoT-based Smart farming for Optimal Yield & Crop Protection.
### OVERVIEW: 
TechFusion_KirtiGarg is an advanced agricultural monitoring system that leverages various sensors to detect and analyze key environmental parameters such as humidity, pH, soil moisture, and water level. The collected data is transmitted to a cloud platform using LoRaWAN, a cost-effective and power-efficient wireless communication technology.

## Features
- Sensor-Based Monitoring: Collects real-time data on soil and environmental conditions.
- LoRaWAN Communication: Enables long-range, low-power data transmission.
- Cloud Storage: Stores sensor data for further analysis.
- Machine Learning Analysis:*
  - FeedForward Deep Neural Networks (DNN) & CNN for large datasets.
  - Random Forest for smaller datasets.
- Multi-Platform Support: Displays insights on a mobile app or a web platform.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React.js

### Backend:
- Flask (Python)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (DNN, CNN, Random Forest)

## Algorithm: 
  1. Convolutional Neural Network Feedforward Deep Neural Network : It is a type of deep learning architecture commonly used 
  in image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. It consists of multiple layers that process input data in a 
  structured manner.
  2. Random Forest:It is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is an 
  ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Development Tools
1. TypeScript Compiler
File: tsconfig.node.json
Description: This file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies options such as the target ECMAScript version, module resolution strategy, and library types. The TypeScript compiler is responsible for transpiling TypeScript code into JavaScript, ensuring type safety and modern JavaScript features are available in the output.
2. PostCSS
File: postcss.config.js
Description: PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. In this project, it is configured to use Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer. PostCSS processes the CSS files, allowing for features like nesting, variables, and other enhancements before they are served to the browser.

### System Architecture
1. Sensor Data Collection: Sensors measure parameters such as humidity, soil moisture, and pH levels.
2. Data Transmission: LoRaWAN device transmits collected data wirelessly to the cloud.
3. Cloud Storage & Processing:Data is stored in a cloud-based platform for further analysis.
4. Machine Learning Analysis: Suitable algorithms are applied based on dataset size.
5. User Interface: Insights and recommendations are displayed on a web or mobile app.
